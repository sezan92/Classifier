In this Project I have developed A Python Code to Determine the Suitable Classifiers from the Six most famous Machine Learning Algorithms with their Hyperparameters for your Dataset. 

I have tried the Code on some famouse Datasets and Imagesets . Like Titanic Dataset , MNIST Digit Imageset, Caltech 101 Imageset, CIFAR-10 Image set and Charity Donors Dataset. I have got inspiration from the github repository of Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Repository. I have written Jupyter Notebooks for MNIST, Caltech101 and CIFAR-10 Dataset so people can take help from them. Any feedback is 
appreciated. 

I have also used Tensorflow Deep Learning Method for CIFAR-10 Dataset. According to Udacity Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree , the Accuracy should be 50-80% using Tensorflow, which is the case in my code as well. Please feel Free to use and share.
